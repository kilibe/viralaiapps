# Viral AI Apps - URL Structure Fixed

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully updated your website to have different URLs for each navigation bar page. Here's what was done:

### 1. **Fixed Resource Paths**
All subdirectory pages now use absolute paths (starting with `/`) for resources:
- CSS: `/styles.css`
- JavaScript: `/navigation.js`, `/script-timeframe-fix.js`, etc.
- Images: `/ViralAi Apps.com2.png`

### 2. **Fixed Navigation Links**
Updated all navigation links in subdirectory pages to use the correct paths:
- Startups: `/` (root)
- Unicorns: `/unicorns/`
- Tracking: `/tracking/`
- Reports: `/reports/`
- API: `/api/`

### 3. **Current Structure**
```
/Users/leepingwong/viralaiapps/
├── index.html              (Startups page - main page)
├── unicorns/
│   └── index.html         (Unicorns page)
├── tracking/
│   └── index.html         (Tracking page)
├── reports/
│   └── index.html         (Reports page)
├── api/
│   └── index.html         (API page)
└── [all other resources remain in root]
```

### 4. **How to Test**
Since you're using absolute paths, you need to run a local web server. I've created a `start-server.sh` script for you:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start-server.sh

# Run the server
./start-server.sh
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. **URLs Now Working**
- http://localhost:8000/ - Startups page
- http://localhost:8000/unicorns/ - Unicorns page
- http://localhost:8000/tracking/ - Tracking page
- http://localhost:8000/reports/ - Reports page
- http://localhost:8000/api/ - API page

### Alternative Testing Methods:
1. **VS Code Live Server**: If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and right-click on index.html → "Open with Live Server"
2. **Python**: Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the terminal from your project directory
3. **Node.js**: Run `npx http-server -p 8000` if you have Node.js installed

## What This Achieves:
- ✅ Each page now has its own unique URL
- ✅ Navigation between pages works correctly
- ✅ All resources (CSS, JS, images) load properly on all pages
- ✅ Active navigation highlighting works based on current URL
- ✅ The site structure is ready for deployment to any web server

The changes are minimal and focused only on fixing the paths - no functionality was altered.
